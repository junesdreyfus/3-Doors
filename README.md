# 3- Doors

My submission for the variation jam. 3 doors stand in a dilapitated building, each leading to the same space. The mode of interaction shifts depending on which. Exploration is the goal here.

This used to be my old cramped appartment in Nice, but I left because my furniture kept disappearing. There was an actual real life trapdoor that lead to the flat's foundation, so I'd rather have it be ghosts. I moved out while in the process of teaching myself blender, rudimentarily archiving each bits and pieces as I knew I wasn't gonna see them again. It's a bit rough around the edges but I like to revisit this model from times to times, altering my relationship to this space.

Have fun exploring, I had fun making this

I watched Mekong Hotel and personal shopper and I thought about 3- Iron and Robinson's garden and Vagabond while making this I think it shows
